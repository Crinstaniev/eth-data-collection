# `web3.py`

Web3.py is a Python library that allows interaction with Ethereum, typically used in decentralized apps. It offers functionality for sending transactions, working with smart contracts, retrieving block information and more. The library's API was initially based on Web3.js (Javascript), but has been adapted to better suit the needs of Python developers. For further information, refer to the official documentation at https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.

## Preparation to run the example

### Local Environment

`web3.py` requries Python 3.6 or higher.

### Ethereum Endpoint

<!-- endpoint? -->
Collecting on-chain data requires an Ethereum endpoint. Best way is to use remote node provider, like [Infura](https://infura.io/), [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), or [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/). [This document](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/) explains how to run a local node or get a remote node.
